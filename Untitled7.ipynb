    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems.\n",

    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of formats, such as key-value pairs, document-based, column-based, or graph-based. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data and provide flexible schema design. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis."
